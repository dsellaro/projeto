Companies are taking advantage of cloud computing to improve their business processes. The cloud computing requires the interaction with many kinds of applications, so it is necessary to improve the performance of software tools that allow keeping information on all these applications consistent and synchronised. Integration platforms are specialised software tools that provide support to design, implement, run, and monitor integration solution. The runtime system is the part of the integration platform responsible for running integration solutions.
Integration platforms, available as iPaaS services, consist of the same platforms designed and implemented for use on on-premise applications, merely encapsulated with a web interface and a few new adapters for connecting applications to the cloud or with cloud services. Therefore, runtime systems need to be adapted to the context of cloud computing, mainly seeking an increase in its performance and an optimization of the consumption of computational resources. 
This proposal presents research directions of our doctoral thesis and how they will be addressed, in order to contribute to migrate and adapt integration technologies to the context of cloud computing.

% \section{Introduction}\label{ch:overview}

% Creation of a formal research proposal is a daunting task; while authors
% such as Zobel~\cite{zobel:97} discuss the basic mechanics of technical
% writing, and writers such as Griffith et al.~\cite{griffiths:97}
% explain the basics of using \LaTeX\ for such writing, there is little
% guidance on the actual structure of a research proposal.
% This structure may vary considerably depending on the nature of the
% research topic---whether it consists of a coding project, a theoretical
% study, a literature survey or other acceptable topics. Despite their
% differences, all proposals share common features, and this paper provides
% a \LaTeX\ template suitable for most such projects. It is expected that
% a user will modify this template according to the specifics of the
% proposed research; in particular, boiler-plate section headings
% and subheadings should be replaced by informative ones specific to
% the topic.

% \subsection{Components of a Proposal}
% The introduction of a proposal typically acquaints the reader with
% the nature of problem being addressed and the basic idea of the
% project being proposed to address it.  It should hit many of the points
% of the abstract while giving more of the motivation and need for the
% work being proposed.  It should then lay out the structure of the
% paper, telling the reader what will be found in the sections which
% follow.  Thus, the next sections should address the following topics:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% the thesis statement and research objectives;
% \item
% prior work and current art---other approaches to the problem and
% their drawbacks;
% \item
% methodology and experiment---including background research
% to be done, necessary equipment and algorithmic techniques, and general
% plan-of-attack;
% \item
% analysis and validation---how results will be judged and interpreted;
% \item
% a time-table for achieving key objectives, and one or more fallback plans
% in cases where goals are not met by specific target dates;
% \item concluding remarks.
% \end{itemize}
% The proposal should also include a bibiography/reading-list.  In
% this case, it is permissible to include references which are not directly
% cited in the text.  (You can use the \verb+\nocite{*}+ command before the
% bibliography section, as below, to include all Bib\TeX\ references
% from a database file in the bibliography.)  You should still cite
% references in the text as appropriate.

% \section{Prior Work}

% Depending on the nature of the topic, prior work should either precede
% or follow the thesis statement.  Some topics will require the
% background information to put the thesis proposal in context.  Others
% are best served by giving the thesis statement first and then contrasting
% and comparing it with prior work in the field.

% \subsection{\TeX}
% If this were a real proposal dealing with how to write proposals,
% it might be appropriate to say a few words
% about Knuth, inventor of the \TeX\ typesetting language \cite{knuth:84}.
% Description of Knuth's contribution goes here.

% \subsection{\LaTeX\ (Lamport, 1984)}
% Description of Lamport's contribution \cite{lamport:94} goes here.

% \subsection{Other Work}
% Description of other contributions leading up to this thesis goes here,
% e.g., Zobel's book on writing for computer science \cite{zobel:97}.

% \section{Thesis}

% It is difficult for students to begin a proposal without an adequate guide;
% my project, therefore, will demonstrate the following thesis:
% %\begin{Thesis}
% \singlespace
% \begin{quote}
% It is both simple and useful to provide students with a \LaTeX\ template
% for their formal thesis proposals.  This will result in far fewer
% questions from students uncertain as to what belongs in their proposals.
% Such a template will be of benefit to students in Computer
% Science/Applied Computing as well as to any others willing and able
% to use \LaTeX\ for their work.
% \end{quote}
% %\end{Thesis}
% \doublespace

% A formal thesis statement should be a \emph{falsifiable} statement about
% the goal you will attempt to achieve with your research project.
% For a purely scientific project, this is the hypothesis you are testing
% with your research.  For an applied programming project, it is usually a
% statement about the feasibility and correctness of your approach and
% the advantages it has over other approaches.  For a survey or study,
% it is usually a statement regarding the need or usefulness of such
% a study, its intended audience, and so on.

% Often, you may want to include an itemized list of goals you plan to
% achieve.  Thus, this paper has the goals of
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% helping students, by ridding their minds of confusion;
% \item
% helping faculty, too, by eliminating their need to say ``No, no, no!
% You need to include a section on \emph{bleh} and \emph{blah}!
% I told \emph{everybody} that.  I thought I told everybody that.  Arrgghh!!!''
% \end{itemize}
% In summary, this section gives the main idea of what you propose,
% with the goals and contributions it will make to the field; the
% details of proposed implementation and methodology will be given later
% in Sec.~\ref{sec:implem}.

% %\section{Prior work II:  advantages of the proposed work over other approaches}

% If you didn't already discuss prior work, this is a good place to do so.
% %You might include these remarks, if brief, in the preceding section.

% \section{Implementation and Methodology}\label{sec:implem}

% Here, you should lay out the details of how you propose to solve the
% problem and otherwise conduct the research necessary to support your
% thesis.  Include details regarding hardware and software you will use,
% resources you will draw on, algorithms you will implement, and other
% ideas about how you will accomplish your task.  It is inevitable that
% your final work will deviate from earlier plans, as you research your
% topic, learn new methods, and discover what works as expected.

% \subsection{Using Tables and Figures}
% Use tables and figures as appropriate; a picture can explain a lot
% in very compact form, and can keep readers interested.  Avoid things
% that are merely flash and do not
% \begin{figure}
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{l l l}
% \epsfxsize=1.8in\epsffile{Nausicaa} &
% \epsfxsize=1.8in\epsffile{Nausicaa} &
% \epsfxsize=1.8in\epsffile{Nausicaa} \\
% \end{tabular}
% \caption{Include images in a proposal as appropriate}\label{fig:nausicaa}
% \end{figure}
% add any relevant information.  (See Fig.~\ref{fig:nausicaa}.)

% \subsection{Working with Code and Pseudocode}
% If you have source code to include, you can do so using the
% \emph{listings} package,
% which will format short inline code fragments such as

% \singlespace
% \begin{lstlisting} {}
% for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
%     cout << "It's easy to add source code to LaTeX documents";
% \end{lstlisting}
% or simply using the \emph{verbatim} environment, which gives a Courier font to literal text:
% \begin{verbatim}
% for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
%     cout << "It's easy to add source code to LaTeX documents";
% \end{verbatim}
% \doublespace
% The listing environment is good for longer code examples and for use in figures,
% such as in Fig.~\ref{fig:surprisecode}.

% \begin{figure}[t]
% \lstset{basicstyle=\scriptsize}
% \lstinputlisting{surprise.c}
% \caption{This mystery code (\copyright 1987 Roemer B.\ Lievaart) was
% included from a source file.  The \LaTeX\ file also shows how to
% change the font-size for a code-listing.}\label{fig:surprisecode}
% \end{figure}

% Another frequent need is to include algorithms written in pseudocode.
% The \emph{algo} package can be used to format algorithms presentably in your
% documents; Fig.~\ref{fig:mutation_adequacy} on
% Pg.~\pageref{fig:mutation_adequacy} shows an example of this.
% For more options on these packages, consult online resources.

% \begin{figure}[t]
% \begin{algorithm}{CalculateMutationAdequacy}[T, P, M_o]

% $MS(P,T,M_o) \qlet \frac{D_{num}}{(|\Phi_P| - E_{num})}$ \\ \label{result}
% $\qreturn \; MS(P,T,M_o)$

% \section{Research and Writing Timetable}\label{sec:timetable}

% Give a brief overview of how you will proceed to accomplish the project,
% including a rough schedule for accomplishing the following tasks:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item background research,
% \item final proposal completion,
% \item proposal defense,
% \item research intermediate and final goals, and
% \item writing of key chapters, leading to final written thesis.
% \end{itemize}
% The timetable should take into account the actual schedule followed by
% the department, CS600 in the fall is devoted to the background research,
% final proposal and its defense, beginnings of primary project work and
% writing of first two chapters.  CS601 in the spring is spent finishing
% the research and the writing and preparing for the thesis defense.

% The timetable section may also include contingency plans---see below in
% Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
